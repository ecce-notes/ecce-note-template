The ECCE detector is a cylindrical detector covering
$\left|\eta\right| \leq 1.1$ and the full azimuth.  It is designed to use
the former BaBar superconducting solenoid to contain
an inner tracking system out to 80~cm in radius followed by an
electromagnetic calorimeter and the first of two longitudinal segments of
a hadronic calorimeter, which is not instrumented in the project baseline.  The second
longitudinal segment of the hadronic calorimeter, which is instrumented to
$|\eta| \leq 1.1$, also serves as
the magnet flux return, surrounding the magnet cryostat.
